# Blog
This is a blogging web application building with the React and Redux and React Router, etc.
## Getting Started
I used the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to initialize this app.
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the Node.js installed, after you install the Node, NPM will also be included.
### Clone 
```
git clone https://github.com/Crysisun/Blog.git
```
### Run the app
```
cd Blog
npm start
```
* Open the client at http://localhost:3000/
* The web app will show up, you can select on the existing posts to view what those posts are or delete them, and you can also add new posts by clicking on the "add a post" button then type in the required fields, if those fields are left blank, error messages will show up and you can't submit the post until meet the requires. 
## Built with
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
